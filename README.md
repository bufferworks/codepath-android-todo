###CodePath Prework - Android ToDo App: *Things*

Time spent: ~8 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:
* [X] User can **successfully add and remove items** from the todo list
* [X] User can **tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the todo item** and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list.
* [X] User can **persist todo items** and retrieve them properly on app restart

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] Persist the todo items into SugarORM instead of a text file
* [X] Improve style of the todo items in the list [using a custom adapter](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-an-ArrayAdapter-with-ListView)
* [X] Add support for completion ~~due dates~~ status, notes (or sub-titles) for todo items (and display within listview item)
* [ ] Use a [DialogFragment](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-DialogFragment) instead of new Activity for editing items
* [X] Add support for selecting the priority of each todo item (and display in listview item)
* [X] Tweak the style improving the UI / UX, play with colors, images or backgrounds

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [X] List the todo items in the order they were created.
* [X] The Toolbar menu has a *Show Done* option to show *Thing*'s marked as **DONE**. Re-clicking the same menu will hide *Thing*'s marked as **DONE** and only show items with status **TODO**.

## Notes

* Spent some time understanding and implementing the Custom Adapter and ORM tool.

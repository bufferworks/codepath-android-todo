- One or more ToDo items, a.k.a *Thing*'s, can be added to the list.
- The Toolbar menu has an *Add Thing* option to navigate to UI to add a thing.
- Every _Thing_ has a title, note, status and priority.
- The *Thing*'s in the list are shown in the order they were created.
- Single click on a *Thing* will navigate to edit it.
- A long click on a *Thing* will delete it.
- By default *Thing*'s marked **DONE** are not shown.
- The Toolbar menu has a *Show Done* option to show *Thing*'s marked as **DONE**. Re-clicking the same menu will hide *Thing*'s marked as **DONE**.
